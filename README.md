# Proposal of CRUD VueJS and Vuex for real-world projects

On many occasions we want to start a project, but we have the basic knowledge, in production we must be more ambitious and try with more efficient solutions.

In this repository I want to use a proposal (WIP) that is not the only way, but it has given me results, besides that it has an important element: keeping things simple.

This project requires a basic API that allows to Create, Read, Update, Delete a user (for this case), you can build it in the language of your preference, you could also take a look at my repository built in laravel https://github.com/braian125/laravel-crud-example.git

If you consider that you can improve some code here, you are welcome, I'm not an expert and I know that maybe I should improve something here, send your proposal please.


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### API
change baseURL in src/store/api.js
